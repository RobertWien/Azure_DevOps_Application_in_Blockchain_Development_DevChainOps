# ☁️ AZURE CLOUD COMPUTING APPLICATION AND DEVOPS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR BUILDING A BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATION UNDER THE DEVCHAINOPS MODEL

This project explores how to apply **Azure Cloud** and the **DevOps Blockchain software development lifecycle** to efficiently build and operate a **blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp)** following the **DevChainOps** model.

It combines modern web development technologies such as **Next.js** for the frontend, **Thirdweb SDK** for blockchain smart contract interactions, and **MetaMask** as the user’s crypto wallet interface. The application is deployed and monitored on **Azure Cloud**, with the entire lifecycle—from planning to deployment and maintenance—automated via **Azure DevOps** pipelines.

The dApp operates on the **Sepolia testnet (Ethereum)**, with backend smart contracts deployed and integrated through **Thirdweb’s contract management tools**.

## 💡 About DevChainOps

**DevChainOps** is a modern development methodology that merges **DevOps principles** with the unique lifecycle of **blockchain applications**—including contract development, testnet/mainnet deployment, frontend/backend integration, and on-chain/off-chain interaction. This project is a practical application of that model.
